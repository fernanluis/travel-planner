How To Use an API with Ruby on Rails

Simple travel planner. This app will allow the user to enter a country of destination and will show them some key details about it (the currency and timezone, for example), plus some weather information. I'm skipping ActiveRecord, since our application won’t be using a database.

For calling the APIs, we’ll be using the excon gem.

Rails version: 6.0.3.4

Ruby version: ruby 2.7.0p0 (2019-12-25 revision 647ee6f091) [x86_64-linux]
